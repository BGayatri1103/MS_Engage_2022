# DATA ANALYSIS
This project aims to analyse data from an automotive industry in order to reveal meaningful insights and forecast prices which can augment decision making and planning especially considering the business perspective. The entire project is divided into three parts:
## Data Preprocessing
The entire project is targeted towards a particular data set from the automotive industry which has been uploaded. The raw data is not something fit to be fed to any model and neither is well suited for analysis. To achieve that, the data has been processed first by dropping redundant columns, collaborating features together and dropping the extra, filling up the missing values and finally filtering out any invalid or exceptional data to bring all data points to a regular plae of distribution.
## Data Visualization
This part is the core of the project which basically focuses on dwelving into the inner details and studying the patterns exhibited by the data. THrough various visualization techniques like bar graphs, pie charts, histograms, etc relations between several determining parameters has been studied which gives an overview of the types of customer segments, their demands and the patterns and trends existing in the market. These insights are important especially considering the business perspective as it serves to be a decisive factor considering new releases.
## Predictive analytics
The last part of the project besically deals on cleaning the dataset further, removing outliers and normalising, encoding the categorical variables to make the data fit for training and testing of model and finally predicting prices using regression analysis.

All the packages and libraries to be imported are mentioned in the files itself. Mostly the packages used include NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, sklearn and statsmodels. All other relevant libraries for encoding and regression have been mentioned in the IPython Notebooks.
